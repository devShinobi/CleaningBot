# CleaningBot

I am trying to make a robot to clean and sweep houses, if possible expand it to industrial scale.
The plan is to 
1.  Create a software which can map an house/indoor location(This in in-progress now)
2.  Create a software which can detect obtsacles that the bot will encounter and classify them into use full and stuff and stuff that can be cleaned 
3.  Integrate the hardware with the developed software

## Dev environment
1.  ROS2- ROS2 has packages for Navigation, SLAM and can be installed on multiple platforms
2.  Docker(I currently have a windows machine and i need a free and light weight OS to be available on the bot's hardware)
3.  I intent use neural networks already trainedin object detection for object identification

## For setup please folow the instructions
follow instuctions from [dev-environment-setup.md](./dev-environment-setup.md)
